> Project Management

This is a repository for general IPFS project management.

tl:dr; We have a **weekly, all-hands call**. The time and date is announced in [the issues](). Propose agenda items in the etherpad linked in that issue!

## How We Work

We use a loose agile approach that uses weekly sprints. Here are some things that are good to know:

  - Every Monday we  have our team sync calls. The most important call is the all-hands call; we try to keep this short, it has an agenda, and anyone (including you) can propose an agenda item for it.
  - Each week has an issue, where you go to get information about that week's calls. That's also where the notes from that week's calls accumulate.
  - There are some project-specific sprint discussions after the all-hands call. You're welcome to go to those, too. Those sprint calls are where we discuss the work everyone will be doing on that project that week. The times for those calls are listed in that week's issue.
  - You do not need to go to all of the video hangouts. They are long. Only go to ones you want to go to. We post the notes (such as they are) in the sprint issue in this repository afterwards.
  - If you want to, telling us what you plan to do or what you've done each week in the sync is great, even if you're not on the IPFS team.
  - If you have questions, ask [RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) on IRC, or email him. He'll help you out.

## Working Hours

To maximize feedback during a sprint, we've picked a set of "working hours" during which we can overlap. The hours are:

```
16:00-19:00 Z/UTC daily or
18:00-21:00 CEST daily or
12:00-15:00 EST daily or
09:00-12:00 PDT daily
```

The committers aim to be available during these hours. Your mileage may vary. 

## Sprints (WIP)

### Sprint Planning

#### Sprint Discussions

**When:** See the list below.

**How:** This takes place synchronously on Google Hangouts.

Our sprints cover many different subject areas, that interest distinct but overlapping groups of people. Everyone is welcome to participate on all of them -- hence they do not overlap in time -- though they are geared towards the main people handling those areas.

The sprint discussions give a high throughput (video call) environment to talk about status, next goals, problems, solution approcahes, and so on. They're mostly free form, but should endeavor to identify a set of tasks to do, even if those tasks won't all get done this sprint.

If you are interested in watching, but do not plan on participating, please use the stream link provided by the discussion lead and watch on YouTube. Some participants may be on low bandwidth connections, and quality is generally better with less participants.

##### Schedule

The schedule for the sprint discussions for each week is on the corresponding ticket for that week's sprint, and in the Google Calendar.

You can add these meeting times to your Calendar app by adding our [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York).

The Hangouts are generated anew for each session. The admin should use the [hangouts guide](hangouts.md) to set these up before the session.
